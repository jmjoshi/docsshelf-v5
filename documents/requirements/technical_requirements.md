# Comprehensive Technical Requirements Document for DocsShelf Mobile App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehen## 5. Best Practices by Area

### 5.1 UI/UXve technical requirements for the DocsShelf mobile app, a cross-platform (iOS/Android) document management solution focused on strict local storage, end-to-end encryption, and offline functionality. It is derived from the functional requirements in `prd.md`, `loginprd.md`, and enhanced subfolders (e.g., `device_storage.md`, `security_compliance.md`), prioritizing security, performance, compliance, and user experience.

The app must handle document upload/scanning, OCR, categorization, search, versioning, secure backups, and local sharing while adhering to GDPR/CCPA, WCAG 2.1, and app store policies. All data remains local unless explicitly enabled by the user.

## 2. Tech Stack Overview

- **Framework**: React Native (with Expo CLI for managed workflow) for cross-platform development.
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- **Database**: SQLite (via react-native-sqlite-storage) for local metadata storage.
- **File Storage**: React Native FS (RNFS) for document management.
- **Encryption**: React Native Keychain + crypto libraries (e.g., AES-256-GCM).
- **OCR/Scanning**: React Native ML Kit or Tesseract.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit.
- **UI/UX**: React Native Paper for components.
- **Testing**: Jest (unit), Detox (E2E).
- **Build/Deployment**: Fastlane for CI/CD, Expo Application Services for app stores.
- **Version Control**: Git with Git LFS.

## 3. Detailed Tech Stack Components

### 3.1 Framework and Language

- **React Native**: Version 0.72+ for stability and native module support. Use Expo for rapid prototyping; switch to CLI for custom native code (e.g., external backups).
- **TypeScript**: Version 4.9+ with strict mode enabled. Use interfaces for data models (e.g., Document, Category).

### 3.2 Database

- **SQLite**: For metadata (categories, tags, versions). Use migrations for schema updates. Enable WAL mode for concurrency.

### 3.3 File Storage

- **RNFS**: For local file operations. Store documents in app-specific directories (e.g., Documents/ on iOS, Internal Storage on Android).

### 3.4 Encryption and Security

- **Key Management**: Device keystore for keys; PBKDF2 for derivation.
- **Libraries**: react-native-crypto for AES-256; react-native-biometrics for MFA.

### 3.5 Integrations

- **Camera/OCR**: expo-camera + react-native-ml-kit.
- **External Backups**: Native modules for USB/SD detection (e.g., react-native-device-info).
- **Sharing**: react-native-nfc-manager for NFC; react-native-qrcode-svg for QR.

### 3.6 APIs

- **Internal APIs**: RESTful endpoints for local operations (e.g., /api/backup/start). Use Express.js if needed for local server emulation.
- **External**: Minimal; only for optional cloud sync (e.g., user-selected providers with OAuth2).

### 3.7 UI/UX

- **Libraries**: React Native Paper for Material Design components.
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for stack/tab navigation.

### 3.8 Testing and Deployment

- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests; Detox for E2E on devices.
- **Deployment**: Fastlane for automated builds; Expo for OTA updates.

## 4. Folder Structure

Based on industry standards for React Native apps (e.g., Airbnb style guide, React Native community best practices), the project follows a modular, scalable structure to separate concerns, improve maintainability, and facilitate testing. Use absolute imports with a `src/` base for clarity.

### 4.3 Best Practices for Folder Structure

- **Modularity**: Group related files (e.g., all document-related code in `screens/Documents/` and `services/storage/`).
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI, logic, and data separate (components in `components/`, business logic in `services/`).
- **Scalability**: Use index files (e.g., `index.ts`) for clean imports; avoid deep nesting.
- **Testing**: Mirror structure in `__tests__/` (e.g., `__tests__/components/Button.test.ts`).
- **Version Control**: Exclude `node_modules/`, `android/`, `ios/` builds from Git; use Git LFS for large assets.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use PascalCase for components/screens, camelCase for files, kebab-case for folders if needed.
- **Documentation**: Add README.md in complex folders (e.g., `services/`) explaining purpose.

## 5. Best Practices by Area
