Lets start building mobile MVP Features, refer to requirements documents from
documents/requirements folder and subfolder.

## 3. Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Establish the development environment, core architecture, and basic app structure.

### Next Steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install Node.js (v18+), React Native CLI, Android Studio, Xcode.
   - Initialize React Native project: `npx react-native init DocsShelf --template typescript`.
   - Set up Expo for rapid prototyping if needed.
   - Configure TypeScript with strict mode and ESLint/Prettier.

Check in the changes in the github repository with a summary, list of components added, updated and
add following to the message as well

documents/requirements folder and subfolders under documents/requirements folder. 2. **Dependency Installation**:

- Install core libraries: React Navigation, Redux Toolkit, React Native SQLite Storage, React Native Keychain, React Native ML Kit (for OCR), React Native Biometrics.
- Add UI libraries: React Native Paper, React Native Vector Icons.
- Install testing tools: Jest, Detox, React Native Testing Library.

documents/requirements folder and subfolders under documents/requirements folder. 3. **Project Structure Refinement**:

- Populate `src/` folders with initial files (e.g., `App.tsx`, `index.ts` in components).
- Set up navigation structure with React Navigation (stack, tab, drawer).
- Configure Redux store with slices for auth, documents, settings.

- Ensure GitHub repo is set up (as per previous steps).
- Configure GitHub Actions for basic linting and build checks.
- Set up Fastlane for automated builds.

**Milestones**:

- Functional app shell with navigation.
- Passing basic tests (unit tests for utilities).
- Documented setup instructions in README.md.

documents/requirements folder and subfolders under documents/requirements folder.

2. **Document Management Basics**:
   - File upload/scanning: Use React Native Image Picker and Camera.
   - Local storage: Implement RNFS for document storage in app directories.
   - Categorization: Create categories/folders with SQLite metadata.
   - Basic search: Implement full-text search on document names/metadata.

==================================
