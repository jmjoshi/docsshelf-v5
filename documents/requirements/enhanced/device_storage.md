| DEV-007        | Backup & Recovery              | As a user, I want reliable backups and easy recovery.                             | The app provides automated backups with one-click restore and incremental backups.                                                                                                |
| DEV-008        | External Device Backup         | As a user, I want to backup to external devices via physical connections.         | The app supports backups to FireWire, USB, USB-C, SD cards, microSD, external HDD/SSD, and other memory devices with physical connections, detecting device type and capacity.    |
| DEV-009        | Wireless Backup Options        | As a user, I want optional wireless backups if desired.                           | The app allows WiFi or Bluetooth backups only when explicitly enabled by the user in settings, with pairing confirmation.                                                         |
| DEV-010        | Secure Transfer Encryption     | As a user, I want all backups encrypted during transfer.                          | All backup transfers use end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3 for wireless, AES-256 for physical) to protect data in transit.                                                           |
| DEV-011        | Encrypted Backup Storage       | As a user, I want backups stored encrypted on external devices.                   | Backups are stored encrypted on external devices, requiring user passphrase for access and supporting multiple encryption keys.                                                   |
| DEV-012        | Backup Verification            | As a user, I want to verify backup integrity.                                     | The app performs integrity checks (SHA-256 hash verification) on backups and alerts on corruption, with repair options.                                                           |
| DEV-013        | Device Compatibility           | As a user, I want backups to work with various memory devices.                    | The app is compatible with FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, and APFS file systems on external devices.                                                                                         |
| DEV-014        | Connection Security            | As a user, I want secure connections for backups.                                 | The app uses secure protocols for wireless (WPA3 for WiFi, BLE Secure for Bluetooth) and validates physical connections.                                                          |
| DEV-015        | Backup UI/UX                   | As a user, I want an intuitive interface for backup processes.                    | The app provides a user-friendly backup wizard with step-by-step guidance, progress bars, and customizable options for frequency, destinations, and encryption settings.          |
| DEV-016        | Error Handling for Connections | As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery for device connection issues. | The app detects connection failures (e.g., disconnected USB, weak WiFi), provides actionable error messages, and offers auto-retry or manual recovery options.                    |
| DEV-017        | Hardware API Integration       | As a user, I want seamless integration with device hardware for backups.          | The app integrates with camera APIs for scanning, storage APIs for external devices, and network APIs for wireless connections, ensuring compatibility and security.              |
| DEV-018        | API Endpoints for Storage      | As a developer, I want defined APIs for storage operations.                       | The app provides RESTful APIs for backup initiation (/api/backup/start), status checking (/api/backup/status), and restoration (/api/backup/restore), with OAuth2 authentication. |
| DEV-019        | API Security Details           | As a developer, I want secure API implementations.                                | APIs use JWT tokens for authentication, rate limiting (100 requests/min), input validation, and HTTPS with certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.              |
| DEV-020        | API Documentation              | As a developer, I want comprehensive API docs.                                    | The app provides Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints, including request/response schemas, error codes, and example payloads.                                          |
| DEV-021        | API Versioning                 | As a developer, I want versioned APIs for backward compatibility.                 | APIs support versioning via URL paths (e.g., /api/v1/backup), with deprecation notices and migration guides for v2 updates.                                                       |
| DEV-022        | API Rate Limiting Details      | As a developer, I want controlled API usage.                                      | Rate limiting at 100 requests/min per user, with exponential backoff for retries, and headers for remaining limits (X-Rate-Limit-Remaining).                                      |
| DEV-023        | API Caching Strategies         | As a developer, I want efficient API performance.                                 | APIs use Redis for caching responses (TTL 5min), ETags for conditional requests, and cache invalidation on data changes.                                                          |
| DEV-024        | Data Migration                 | As a user, I want seamless data migration during updates.                         | The app supports automatic data migration for app updates, preserving encrypted documents and settings without user intervention.                                                 |
| DEV-025        | Data Migration Strategies      | As a developer, I want robust migration methods.                                  | Migration uses incremental updates, rollback on failure, and user notifications for large migrations, with encryption maintained throughout.                                      |
