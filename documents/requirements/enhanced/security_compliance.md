| Requirement ID | Description                          | User Story                                                                                                                   | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-001        | End-to-End Encryption                | As a user, I want all my documents and data to be encrypted at rest and in transit, so that my information is always secure. | The system must use AES-256-GCM for data at rest and TLS 1.3 with ECDHE for data in transit.                               |
| SEC-002        | Zero-Knowledge Storage               | As a user, I want only myself to be able to decrypt my documents, so that my privacy is guaranteed.                          | Documents are encrypted with user-specific keys derived from PBKDF2; app/server cannot access user data.                   |
| SEC-003        | Granular Multi-Factor Authentication | As a user, I want MFA for login, document access, and sensitive actions, so that my account and documents are protected.     | MFA is required for login, document access, and sharing/exporting documents, supporting TOTP, SMS, and biometric.          |
| SEC-004        | Biometric Authentication             | As a user, I want to use fingerprint or face unlock for added security.                                                      | The app supports biometric authentication as an additional factor using device hardware.                                   |
| SEC-005        | Audit Logs                           | As a user, I want to see all access and changes to my documents for compliance and review.                                   | The app maintains tamper-proof audit logs with timestamps, user actions, and IP addresses.                                 |
| SEC-006        | Legal & Regulatory Compliance        | As a user, I want my data to be handled according to laws like GDPR and CCPA.                                                | The app supports user consent management, data export/deletion, and compliance reporting with automated data minimization. |
| SEC-007        | Secure Key Management                | As a user, I want my encryption keys to be securely managed and backed up.                                                   | Keys are stored in device keystore (iOS Keychain/Android Keystore) and backed up encrypted with user passphrase.           |
| SEC-008        | Data Integrity Checks                | As a user, I want to ensure my documents are not tampered with.                                                              | The app uses HMAC-SHA256 for integrity verification and alerts on mismatches.                                              |
| SEC-009        | Secure Wipe                          | As a user, I want to securely delete documents and data.                                                                     | The app overwrites data with random bytes before deletion, following NIST guidelines.                                      |
| SEC-010        | Backup Encryption                    | As a user, I want backups to be fully encrypted.                                                                             | All backups are encrypted with AES-256 at rest and in transit, with user-controlled keys.                                  |
