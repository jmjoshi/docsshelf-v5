| PERF-001       | Fast App Launch                  | As a user, I want the app to launch quickly, so I can access my documents immediately. | The app launches within 1.5 seconds on modern devices (iOS/Android).                                                                                      |
| PERF-002       | Efficient Document Loading       | As a user, I want documents to load quickly, even for large files.                     | Documents load within 2 seconds for files up to 50MB on 4G/5G networks.                                                                                   |
| PERF-003       | Low Memory Usage                 | As a user, I want the app to use minimal memory, so it doesn't drain my battery.       | The app uses less than 80MB RAM during normal operation, with automatic memory management.                                                                |
| PERF-004       | Scalable Storage                 | As a user, I want to store thousands of documents without performance degradation.     | The app handles up to 10,000 documents with sub-500ms search times using indexed databases.                                                               |
| PERF-005       | Background Processing            | As a user, I want OCR and encryption to run in the background without blocking the UI. | All heavy operations are asynchronous, with progress bars and cancellation options.                                                                       |
| PERF-006       | Battery Optimization             | As a user, I want the app to be battery-efficient.                                     | The app optimizes for low power consumption, using <5% battery per hour in idle mode.                                                                     |
| PERF-007       | Error Handling & Recovery        | As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully and recover automatically.       | The app provides clear error messages, auto-recovery for network issues, and manual recovery options.                                                     |
| PERF-008       | Offline Performance              | As a user, I want full functionality offline without slowdowns.                        | The app maintains 100% functionality offline with local caching and queueing for sync.                                                                    |
| PERF-009       | Device Connection Error Handling | As a user, I want robust handling of device connection errors.                         | The app gracefully handles connection timeouts, disconnections, and incompatibilities with user-friendly recovery mechanisms and logging for diagnostics. |
| PERF-010       | Performance Benchmarks           | As a developer, I want defined benchmarks for key operations.                          | The app meets benchmarks: search <500ms for 10k docs, backup <10min for 1GB, OCR <5s per page, with <2% CPU usage during idle.                            |
| PERF-011       | Additional Benchmarks            | As a developer, I want benchmarks for scalability and edge cases.                      | Benchmarks include handling 50k documents with <1s search, sync <5min for 500MB over WiFi, and battery drain <10% per hour during heavy use.              |
