- Ensure compliance with GDPR/CCPA, WCAG 2.1, and app store policies.
- Achieve <2s load times, <80MB RAM usage, and zero-knowledge encryption.
- Support 10,000+ documents with sub-500ms search.

**Assumptions**:

- Team: 1-2 developers (full-stack mobile), 1 QA, 1 designer.
- Tools: React Native CLI, Expo for prototyping, GitHub for version control.
- Budget: Covers development, testing, and basic deployment.
