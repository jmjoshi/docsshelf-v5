jmjoshi: Lets proceed to next feature development

GitHub Copilot: I'll review the current progress and proceed with the next feature development based on the roadmap. Let me analyze what's been completed and what's next. 

Created 7 todos

Based on your roadmap and the attached documentation, I can see excellent progress has been made! Let me check the current status and proceed with the next feature. 

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/PHASE2_PRIORITY6_DOCUMENT_SCANNING_COMPLETE.md)

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/documents/requirements/FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md#154-154), lines 154 to 184

Perfect! I can see that Priority 6 (Document Scanning) has been completed and now we need to proceed with **Priority 7: OCR & Intelligent Document Processing**. This is the next logical step according to the roadmap. 

Starting (2/7) *Analyze Priority 7 requirements*

Let me read the complete Priority 7 requirements from the roadmap: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/documents/requirements/FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md#124-124), lines 124 to 154

Starting (3/7) *Install OCR dependencies*

Excellent! Based on the roadmap and current progress, I can see that:

## ðŸ“Š **Current Status Analysis**

### âœ… **COMPLETED PHASES**
- **Phase 1 (100% Complete)**: User Registration, MFA, Onboarding
- **Phase 2 (75% Complete)**: Categories, Document Upload, Document Scanning

### ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT PRIORITY: Priority 7 - OCR & Intelligent Document Processing**

Now let's proceed with implementing Priority 7. Let me start by installing the required OCR dependencies: 

Ran terminal command: npm install tesseract.js

Ran terminal command: npm install react-native-blob-util

Ran terminal command: npx expo install expo-camera expo-media-library

Great! Now let me create the OCR service implementation: 

Starting (4/7) *Create OCR service implementation*

Created [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/services/documents/DocumentOCRService.ts)

Now let me create an OCR result screen to display and edit OCR results: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/screens/Documents/OCRResultsScreen.tsx)

Now let me update the navigation to include the OCR results screen: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx#1-1), lines 1 to 21

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx#40-40), lines 40 to 63

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I need to update the types file to include the OCRResults route: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/types/index.ts)

I need to add the OCR results screen to the navigation types: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me update the DocumentUploadScreen to automatically run OCR on uploaded files: 

Starting (5/7) *Implement document classification*

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/screens/Documents/DocumentUploadScreen.tsx#1-1), lines 1 to 31

Let me find the right place to add OCR processing in the DocumentUploadScreen: 

Searched text for `uploadDocument.*completed` (`**/DocumentUploadScreen.tsx`), no results

Searched text for `(upload|process).*complete` (`**/DocumentUploadScreen.tsx`), 6 results

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/screens/Documents/DocumentUploadScreen.tsx#145-145), lines 145 to 175

Let me find where documents are actually processed after upload: 

Searched text for `uploadDocument.*success.*result` (`**/DocumentUploadScreen.tsx`), no results

Read [](file:///c%3A/projects/docsshelf-v5/src/screens/Documents/DocumentUploadScreen.tsx#115-115), lines 115 to 145

Perfect! I can see where the documents are successfully uploaded. Let me add OCR processing right after the successful upload. First, let me add the import for the OCR service: 

Continue to iterate?
[object Object]

Made changes.

jmjoshi: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

Now let me add OCR processing after successful upload: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me update the DocumentScannerScreen to also trigger OCR processing: 

Made changes.
